            Description
            Noita is a magical action rogue-lite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself.
            
            Noita is inspired by underground classics such as Liero, falling sand games, and modern roguelike-likes, -lites and -lite-like-lites.
            
            The game is being developed by the creators of Crayon Physics Deluxe, The Swapper and Baba Is You using Nolla Games’ in-house Falling Everything Engine. Noita is currently available in Early Access and Noita 1.0 will be available on October 15th 2020.
            
            Features
            Pixel-based physics: Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in blood of your foes!
            Your own magic: Create new spells as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use your magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you.
            Action rogue-lite: Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don’t despair, use what you’ve learned to get further on your next adventure.
            Procedurally generated world: Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper.

            About Nolla Games
            Nolla Games is a company that was setup by 3 indie developers, all of whom have worked on their own projects in the past. In fact over the years the gentlemen in question have worked on over 150 titles. Though the quality of the released titles varies from IGF Seumas McNally Grand Prize winning games to ... well ...

            Arvi Teikari
            Arvi is also known as Hempuli. Over the years he has released a lot of tiny experimental games, so many in fact that he is unaware of all of them. One of the games he remembers making is Baba Is You.
